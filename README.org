* UID
Web-friendly microservice for generating unpredictable UIDs.

** Install
The environment variables =UID_HOST= and =UID_PORT= can be used to set the address and port
that the server listens to.
The default values are localhost and 8080.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/BlackGlory/uid
cd uid
yarn install
yarn build
yarn bundle
yarn --silent start
#+END_SRC

*** Docker
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run \
  --detach \
  --publish 8080:8080 \
  blackglory/uid
#+END_SRC

**** docker-compose.yml
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  uid:
    image: 'blackglory/uid'
    restart: always
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
#+END_SRC

** API
*** Public
**** Nano ID
=GET /nanoid=

Return string.

***** Example
****** curl
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl http://localhost:8080/nanoid
#+END_SRC

****** JavaScript
#+BEGIN_SRC js
await fetch('http://localhost:8080/nanoid').then(res => res.text())
#+END_SRC

**** UUID
=GET /uuid=

Return string.

***** Example
****** curl
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl http://localhost:8080/uuid
#+END_SRC

****** JavaScript
#+BEGIN_SRC js
await fetch('http://localhost:8080/uuid').then(res => res.text())
#+END_SRC

** HTTP/2
UID supports HTTP/2 for multiplexed reverse proxy connections,
which can be enabled by setting the environment variable =UID_HTTP2=true=.

This HTTP/2 support does not provide an automatic upgrade from HTTP/1.1,
nor does it provide HTTPS.
Therefore, the =--http2-prior-knowledge= option needs to be enabled when testing in local curl.
